# MadMario

PyTorch [official tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/mario_rl_tutorial.html) to build an AI-powered Mario.

## Running

To start the **learning** process for Mario,

```
python main.py
```

This starts the *double Q-learning* and logs key training metrics to `checkpoints`. In addition, a copy of `MarioNet` and current exploration rate will be saved.

GPU will automatically be used if available. Training time is around 80 hours on CPU and 20 hours on GPU.

To **evaluate** a trained Mario,

```
python replay.py
```

This visualizes Mario playing the game in a window. Performance metrics will be logged to a new folder under `checkpoints`. Change the `load_dir`, e.g. `checkpoints/2020-06-06T22-00-00`, in `Mario.load()` to check a specific timestamp.

## Project Structure

**main.py**
Main loop between Environment and Mario

**agent.py**
Define how the agent collects experiences, makes actions given observations and updates the action policy.

**wrappers.py**
Environment pre-processing logics, including observation resizing, rgb to grayscale, etc.

**neural.py**
Define Q-value estimators backed by a convolution neural network.

**metrics.py**
Define a `MetricLogger` that helps track training/evaluation performance.

## Key Metrics

- Episode: current episode
- Step: total number of steps Mario played
- Epsilon: current exploration rate
- MeanReward: moving average of episode reward in past 100 episodes
- MeanLength: moving average of episode length in past 100 episodes
- MeanLoss: moving average of step loss in past 100 episodes
- MeanQValue: moving average of step Q value (predicted) in past 100 episodes
